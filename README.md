This repository contains various JavaScript functions and code snippets I wrote while learning the language. It includes practice with basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, objects, functions, and DOM manipulation. These examples helped me understand how JavaScript works in the browser and how to build logic step by step.
